# Capstone-Project

The Design and Implementation of a User-Level, Real-Time Waste Management System is an
IoT-based prototype developed to improve waste management efficiency within a university
campus environment. Waste management has emerged as one of the burning issues in today's
world due to increasing urbanization, industrialization and population growth.
Approximately 80% of garbage collections take place at the incorrect time. Conventional
methods cause overflowing trash cans, filthy surroundings, complaints from the public, unlawful
disposal, and higher cleaning and collection expenses are all consequences of late waste
collection. Carbon emissions from early rubbish collection are needless. This not only increases
operational inefficiency but also poses environmental and health risks.
To address these issues, our team, Group 01, designed a real-time system that can intelligently
detect bin fill levels, classify waste types, and send live data to a cloud-based platform accessible
by maintenance authorities. Our team built a fully functional smart waste bin that uses
Raspberry Pi, IoT sensors and a YOLOv8n machine learning model to automatically classify and
sort waste in real time. We focused on making the system practical, efficient and sustainable
combining automation with real engineering application. Once the waste level crosses a set
threshold, the system transmits data wirelessly through a Wi-Fi module to a central cloud
dashboard. This ensures that the cleaning staff receives timely alerts for collection, thereby
preventing overflow and improving maintenance response time.
A major advantage of our design is its real-time operation and user-level accessibility. Both users
and waste management authorities can monitor bin status through the dashboard, making the
system transparent and data-driven. Furthermore, by analyzing fill-level data, the system can
help optimize collection routes, ultimately saving time, energy, and resources.
The implementation of this prototype also includes a machine learning-based waste classification
model that improves sorting accuracy over time. After rigorous trials, we have achieved 92%
sorting accuracy. The design also incorporates features like scheduled waste data logging,
notification alerts, and IoT-based remote monitoring, making it a comprehensive and modern
waste management solution.During testing, the prototype demonstrated efficient detection
accuracy and reliable data transmission, with an average response delay of less than a second.
The system successfully differentiated biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste and
maintained continuous real-time updates between the smart bin and the monitoring dashboard.
In essence, this project embodies the practical integration of IoT, automation, and data analytics
to build a sustainable and intelligent solution for modern waste management. The system not
only contributes to cleaner environments but also promotes awareness of responsible waste
disposal practices among users transforming the traditional process into a smarter, safer, and
more efficient one.
